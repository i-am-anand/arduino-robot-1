TITLE     : IR (TV remote) based arduino gripper robot
OBJECTIVE : TO LEARN TO INTERFACE ARDUINO WITH COMMON SENSORS AND ACTUATORS SUCH AS 
          1. IR sensor    2.Sonar sensor    3.LCD     4.dc motors   5. servo motors 
HARDWARE  :  1. IR sensor    2. Sonar sensor      3. LCD        4.dc motors   5. servo motors  6. IC293D   7.Breadboard     8. Wires
            9. arduino uno  10.mechanical frame  11.TV remote  5.batteries
WORKING   : Power button when pressed on remote will start execution of code on robot 
            lcd will print all the commands received by IR receiver
            four buttons on remote will control forward backward right and left movement of robot
            special button on remote to trigger sonar sensor and print distance on lcd
            special buttons on remote to activate and deactivate servo gripper
